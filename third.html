    <p> I like Chemistry and Math but I dislike English Literature and Gym :(. My achievements are being able to run more than 25 on the Pacer exam. I think CS class is very fun.</p>

    I like these sports because they are fun to play!:
    <ul>
      <li> Basketball is my favorite because I have played it for a long time and I like playing with my friends that also play basketball </li>
      <li> Soccer is my second favorite because I used to be on a soccer team and I played it. It is below basketball because running makes me tired</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    I like these colours in this order:
    <ol>
      <li> Black is good because black clothes look cool B)</li>
      <li> Green is bad because it looks like vomit </li>
    </ol>
